# netnew: a replication package for Mele (2015)
This is an R package for replication of the methods and analysis in __A Structural Model of Segregation in Social Networks__. 

To install the package from the Github repository, you need to have `devtools` already installed.   
If you don't have the `devtools`, install it using the following command

```r
install.packages("devtools")
```

Then open `devtools` and use the `install_github` command to download and install `netnew`:
```r
library(devtools)
install_github("meleangelo/netnew")
```

This should install the package. This works well in Windows, using RStudio.   
To use the package just open it as an R library
```r
library(netnew)
```

Now you should be able to run the codes.
